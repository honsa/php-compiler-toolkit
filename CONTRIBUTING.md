# Pull Request Process

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the [README.md](README.md) with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters (if applicable).
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
